My function idea: When I did the mini data analysis 2 on examining the relationships between 2 variables, I keep producing the figure between two numeric columns' variables and checking if there's a linear relationship between them, thus I would like make a plot function on examining 2 variables' linear relationship.

```{r}
# Exercise 1 & Exercise 2
#' Title: Linear Relationship Plot between Two Variables
#'
#' Function Description: Quickly generates a scatter plot to examine the linear relationship between two specified variables in a given data frame. It fits a linear model (lm) to the data and adds it to the plot.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing the variables to be plotted, the abbreviation of dataframe is always used as df.
#' @param x_var The name of the independent variable column in the data frame as a string, dependent variable is always represented as x variable in statistics, so we get the abbreviation here, as x_var.
#' @param y_var The name of the dependent variable column in the data frame as a string, dependent variable is always represented as y variable in statistics, so we get the abbreviation here, as y_var.
#' @param na.rm Logical. Whether to remove rows with missing values (NA) in the specified columns before plotting. I set the default as FALSE.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to geom_smooth() function for customization.
#'
#' @return A ggplot object representing the scatter plot with a linear fit. The plot can be further modified or directly displayed.

lm_check <- function (df, x_var, y_var, na.rm = FALSE, ...) {
  # Check if variables exist in the dataframe
  if (!(x_var %in% names(df)) || !(y_var %in% names(df))) {
    stop("Variables not found in the dataframe.")
  }
  # Check for zero-length data
  if (nrow(df) == 0) {
    stop("data must have at least 1 row to plot")
  }
  # Prepare data, remove missing values if na.rm is TRUE
  data_to_plot <- df
  if (na.rm) {
    data_to_plot <- na.omit(data_to_plot[, c(x_var, y_var)])
  }
  # Create the plot
  plot <- ggplot(data_to_plot, aes_string(x = x_var, y = y_var)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = FALSE, ...) +
    theme_minimal() 
  return(plot)
}
```

```{r}
# Check for the dataset apt_buildings
head (apt_buildings)
apt_buildings <- apt_buildings %>% 
  filter(no_of_units <= 1000)
```

```{r}
# Exercise 3 (Example 1) - check the linear relationship between no_of_units and no_of_storeys in apt_buildings dataset and fit a linear regression line, we can see that there's a positive relationship between no_of_units and no_of_storeys. 
check1 <- lm_check(df = apt_buildings, x_var = "no_of_units", y_var = "no_of_storeys", na.rm = TRUE)
print(check1)
```

```{r}
# Exercise 3 (Example 2) - check the relationship between no_of_units and no_of_elevators in apt_buildings dataset and fit a linear regression line, we can see that there's a positive relationship between no_of_units and no_of_elevators. 
check2 <- lm_check(df = apt_buildings, x_var = "no_of_units", y_var = "no_of_elevators", na.rm = TRUE)
print(check2)
```
```{r}
# Exercise 4
# Test 1: Check that the function returns a ggplot object with valid input and no NAs
test_that("lm_check returns a ggplot object with no NAs", {
  data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 1:10) # Vector with no NAs
  expect_is(lm_check(data, "x", "y"), "ggplot", 
            info = "lm_check should return a ggplot object with valid input and no NAs.")
})

# Test 2: Check that the function still works and omits NAs when na.rm is TRUE
test_that("lm_check handles NAs correctly when na.rm is TRUE", {
  data_with_na <- data.frame(x = c(1:5, NA, 7:10), y = c(1:5, NA, 7:10)) # Vector with NAs
  plot <- lm_check(data_with_na, "x", "y", na.rm = TRUE)
  expect_is(plot, "ggplot", 
            info = "lm_check should handle NAs correctly when na.rm is TRUE.")
  expect_equal(sum(is.na(data_with_na$x)), 1, 
               info = "There should be exactly one NA in the test data.")
})

# Test 3: Check for correct error message when supplied with a vector of length 0
test_that("lm_check handles vector of length 0 correctly", {
  data_empty <- data.frame(x = numeric(0), y = numeric(0)) # Vector of length 0
  expect_error(lm_check(data_empty, "x", "y"), 
               "data must have at least 1 row to plot", 
               info = "lm_check should error with informative message when vector length is 0.")
})
```
