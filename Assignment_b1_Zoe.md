My function idea: When I did the mini data analysis 2 on examining the
relationships between 2 variables by using apt_buildings dataset, I keep
producing the figure between two numeric variables and checking if
thereâ€™s a linear relationship between them, thus I would like make a
plot function on examining 2 variablesâ€™ linear relationship.

``` r
# Exercise 1 & Exercise 2
#' Title: Linear Relationship Plot between Two Variables
#'
#' Function Description: Quickly generates a scatter plot to examine the linear relationship between two specified variables in a given data frame. It fits a linear model (lm) to the data and adds it to the plot.
#'
#' @param df A data frame containing the variables to be plotted, the abbreviation of dataframe is always used as df.
#' @param x_var The name of the independent variable column in the data frame as a string, dependent variable is always represented as x variable in statistics, so we get the abbreviation here, as x_var.
#' @param y_var The name of the dependent variable column in the data frame as a string, dependent variable is always represented as y variable in statistics, so we get the abbreviation here, as y_var.
#' @param na.rm Logical. Whether to remove rows with missing values (NA) in the specified columns before plotting. I set the default as FALSE.
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to geom_smooth() function for customization.
#'
#' @return A ggplot object representing the scatter plot with a linear fit. The plot can be further modified or directly displayed.

lm_check <- function (df, x_var, y_var, na.rm = FALSE, ...) {
  # Check if variables exist in the dataframe
  if (!(x_var %in% names(df)) || !(y_var %in% names(df))) {
    stop("Variables not found in the dataframe.")
  }
  # Check for zero-length data
  if (nrow(df) == 0) {
    stop("data must have at least 1 row to plot")
  }
  # Prepare data, remove missing values if na.rm is TRUE
  data_to_plot <- df
  if (na.rm) {
    data_to_plot <- na.omit(data_to_plot[, c(x_var, y_var)])
  }
  # Create the plot
  plot <- ggplot(data_to_plot, aes (x = .data[[x_var]], y = .data[[y_var]])) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "blue", se = FALSE, ...) +
    theme_minimal() 
  return(plot)
}
```

``` r
# Tidy the apt_buildings dats a little bit for a more constrained plot
apt_buildings <- apt_buildings %>% 
  filter(no_of_units <= 1000)
```

``` r
# Exercise 3 (Example 1) - check the linear relationship between no_of_units and no_of_storeys in apt_buildings dataset and fit a linear regression line, we can see that there's a positive relationship between no_of_units and no_of_storeys. 
check1 <- lm_check(df = apt_buildings, x_var = "no_of_units", y_var = "no_of_storeys", na.rm = TRUE)
print(check1)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
